        <h1>Experiment Instructions</h1>

        Thank you for agreeing to participate in today’s experiment. This is a study to compare the performance of 2 types of menus: Marking menu and Radial menu.

        For each type of the menus, there are
        - 3 different depths: 1, 2, 3
        - 2 different breadths (how many items in each depth): 4, 8
        - 2 different input devices: touch pad, mouse

        This experiment will consist of 24 trials, corresponding to 24 different combinations of the above-mentioned dimensions. Each trial consists of 3 different tasks. In each task, you will be asked to select one specific item from the menu.

        A simple demo will be given by the instructor on how to select item from these 2 types of menus. If you are unsure of how to use the menu, please approach the instructor for a short practice session before starting experiment trials.

        If the menu depth is 2 or 3, the menu items in the next layer are linked to the items of their parent layer. An example will be:

        To find “Computer1” you will need to select “Electronics” in layer 1  “Computer” in layer 2  “Computer1” in layer 3
